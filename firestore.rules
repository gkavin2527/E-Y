/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for an e-commerce application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is split into two distinct parts: a public, read-only product
 * catalog and private, user-owned data. Admins have elevated privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Products are in a top-level `products` collection for easier management.
 * - All user-specific data is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Orders are in a top-level `orders` collection so admins can list them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read: All product data is publicly readable for browsing.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: All write operations on products are restricted to admins.
 *   This is a critical security measure.
 * - User Privacy: User profiles and carts are strictly private. A user can only
 *   access their own data.
 * - Order Access: Users can only read their own orders. Admins can read all orders.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on path-based security for user-owned data. The user's role
 * is checked via a `get()` call to their profile, which is an efficient and
 * secure way to manage permissions.
